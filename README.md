# gemma2_colab

A simple, Colab-ready toolkit to run GEMMA (GWAS) analyses and use a local Ollama assistant for guided help.

Why this project matters
- Make genetic association analysis easy and repeatable for students and researchers.
- Let users run GEMMA inside Google Colab without complex local installs.
- Add a local LLM (Ollama) to give explanations, suggestions, and help interpret results while keeping data private.
- Great for teaching, small labs, and reproducible research.

Key benefits
- Easy start: step-by-step Colab notebooks install tools and run examples.
- Privacy-first: Ollama runs locally in the Colab session, so data and prompts do not go to external APIs by default.
- Reproducible: notebooks keep commands, logs, and plots together for sharing and teaching.
- Helpful for learning: the local assistant explains results and suggests next steps.

What’s included
- run_ollama_server.ipynb — Colab notebook to install Ollama, start the local Ollama server, and pull models.
- run_ollama_server.md — short, simple documentation for the notebook.
- Example GEMMA notebooks and helper scripts (if present, see notebooks/ or scripts/).

Quick start (short)
1. Open run_ollama_server.ipynb in Google Colab.
2. Run the install cell to install Ollama. The installer will print messages and the API address (127.0.0.1:11434).
3. Start the Ollama server in the background: `!nohup bash -c "ollama serve" &` and check `/content/nohup.out` for logs.
4. Open the GEMMA notebook, upload your PLINK files (BED/BIM/FAM) and phenotype file, and run the analysis cells.
5. Use the local Ollama assistant (from the notebook) to ask questions about results or get plotting help.

Simple example commands (Colab cells)
```bash
# Install Ollama
!curl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# Start server in background and show logs
!nohup bash -c "ollama serve" &
!sleep 5 && tail /content/nohup.out

# (Optional) Pull a model
!ollama pull gemma2:9b-instruct-q5_0
```

Recommended workflow
1. Prepare PLINK files and phenotype file (or use example dataset).
2. Run the GEMMA analysis cells in the notebook.
3. Use the notebook to compute kinship matrices, run mixed models, and save results.
4. Ask the local Ollama assistant to summarize findings, suggest covariates, or help generate plots (Manhattan, QQ).

Privacy & best practices
- Run Ollama and analysis inside your Colab environment to avoid sending sensitive data to external services.
- If you must use external APIs, remove or anonymize sensitive information first.
- Keep notebooks and small example datasets in the repo for reproducible demos.

Use cases
- Teaching GWAS concepts in hands-on workshops.
- Small research projects that need a quick, shareable GWAS pipeline.
- Interactive analysis when you want fast interpretation and explainable help from a local assistant.

Contributing
- Add small example datasets and a tutorial notebook that walks from PLINK to results.
- Add a Colab badge and a short demo that shows the full flow.
- Improve docs, add tests, or provide more model examples for Ollama.
