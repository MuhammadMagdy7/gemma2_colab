# Run Ollama Server (simple English)

This file explains the run_ollama_server.ipynb notebook in simple English and gives clear steps to install and run Ollama in Google Colab.

## Purpose

- Show how the notebook installs Ollama, starts the Ollama server, and pulls a model.
- Use simple English so new users can follow along in Colab.

## Quick overview

1. Install Ollama using the official install script.
2. Set the model id you want to use.
3. Start the Ollama server in the background.
4. Wait for the server to be ready and watch the logs.
5. The notebook will pull the model automatically (you will see large download logs).

## Commands (run in Colab cells)

```bash
# Install Ollama
!curl https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh

# (Optional) Set the model id used in the notebook
ollama_model_id = "gemma2:9b-instruct-q5_0"

# Start the Ollama server in background and show logs
!nohup bash -c "ollama serve" &
!sleep 5 && tail /content/nohup.out
```

Notes:
- The install script places Ollama under /usr/local and prints the API address (127.0.0.1:11434).
- Running `ollama serve` starts the local API server. The notebook runs it with nohup so it keeps running.
- The server logs show messages like "Listening on 127.0.0.1:11434" when ready.

## What to expect

- You will see a short installation output, then messages about the server and keys being generated.
- When a model is requested or pre-pulled, you will see very long download logs (several GB). The notebook shows a model pull of about 6.5 GB.

## Tips and troubleshooting

- If the notebook warns about missing GPU detection, Colab may not expose GPUs to the install script. Install `lspci` or `lshw` in the system if you want GPU detection.
- If the server does not start, check /content/nohup.out for details.
- To stop Ollama: run `!pkill -f ollama` in a notebook cell.

## Optional commands

```bash
# Pull a model manually (example)
!ollama pull gemma2:9b-instruct-q5_0

# List installed models
!ollama list
```

## Short explanation of logfile lines you may see

- "Creating ollama user" and related messages: installer actions.
- "Unable to detect NVIDIA/AMD GPU": GPU autodetection warning.
- "Listening on 127.0.0.1:11434": server is ready.
- Large lines with "pulling ... 6.5 GB": model download progress.
